//! This library implements datatype generics, Ã  la `GHC.Generics` [\[1\]][1] [\[2\]][2].
//!
//! `Generic` is the core trait upon which this library is built.
//!
//! Using `Generic`, types can be converted to and from a simpler set of types
//! representing their basic structure.
//!
//! Useful operations can be implemented inductively on those simpler types,
//! eliminating the need to write boilerplate for each individual type.
